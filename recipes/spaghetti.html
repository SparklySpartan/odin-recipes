        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>So good and so easy. The best kind is mom's spaghetti, but sometimes I have to make my spaghetti, and that's what this is.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sauce</li>
            <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Defrost the ground beef by keeping it in the fridge a couple hours before cooking time.</li>
            <li>Get some water to a pot and bring it to a boil on your stove.</li>
            <li>Put the meat in a pan and let it cook also on the stove.</li>
            <li>When the noodles are the way you want them, drain the pot.</li>
            <li>When the meet is cooked and broken up into a bunch of little pieces add the sauce and let it simmer a bit.</li>
            <li>Finally, when both components are ready, you add the sauce and meat to the pot with the noodles and mix them together</li>
            <li>I recommend adding parmesian cheese, and if you're a psycho like me add sriracha and/or tobasco sauce.</li>
            <li>The end!</li>
        </ol>
